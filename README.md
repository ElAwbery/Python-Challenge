# Python-Practice

Most of these exercises and drills are taken from sources I've found online. There is a link to the source at the top of the files. My solutions are not always the same as those given by the source, sometimes I provide a more efficient solution or one that is better in some way. Other times the sample solution was better than my own. I usually add comments to explain multiple solution versions. 

If a file does not contain a reference to a source, the problems are my own versions of well known test sets (eg: card-deck, domino problems). 

w3resource provided me with most of the early practice I was looking for:

The bin packing problems were created from examples in the wikipedia article:

Some of the dictionary, lists and loops problems are taken from previous tests and past term exams on the MIT 6.001.edx course in computer science.

Some exercises in the lists, loops and dictionary files were from [Think Python](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/thinkpython2.pdf) by Alan Downey.

There are many resources online explaining decorators. The one I liked best was the [RealPython primer on decorators](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/). 

My regular expression exercises are taken from the Regex tutorial on [Ï€rogram](https://www.pirogram.com). 
This tutorial is designed for Python users and takes you from scratch with practice exercises for each step in the process of building the regex syntax. By the end of the tutorial I found I was automatically using the syntax without thinking about it.
