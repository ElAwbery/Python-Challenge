first_fit(items, bin_size) takes a list of integers, representing the sizes of items to fit in bins. 
The items can be no greater than bin_size. The procedure returns a list of lists. 
Each entry in the top-level list represents a bin. The bin is represented as a list of integers, 
taken from the items argument, that are â€œpacked" into the bin. 
The sum of the list must be no greater than bin_size.

first_fit processes the items argument in the order given. For each item, 
it attempts to place the item in the first bin that can accommodate the item 
(i.e. the first one such that the sum of the items already in the bin, plus the item being processed, 
is <= bin_size). If no existing bin has enough room, first_fit creates a new bin 
(a new bin-list added to the top-level list of bins) and puts the item in the new bin.

eg: first_fit([8, 3, 9, 1, 4, 2, 5, 7], 10) => [[8,1], [3,4,2], [9], [5], [7]]

The following was added as one line into the above code:
Now implement first_fit_decreasing (explained in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem#Analysis_of_approximate_algorithms ). 
This just sorts the input in decreasing order, and then does first_fit.

first_fit_decreasing([8, 3, 9, 1, 4, 2, 5, 7], 10) = first_fit([9, 8, 7, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 10) 
=> [[9, 1], [8, 2], [7, 3], [5, 4]]

Now try modified_first_fit_decreasing 
(described at the end of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem#First-fit_algorithm ). 
For this, you might want to go with a bin_size of 12 to get the 1/2, 1/3, and 1/6 bin sizes 
to come out as integers.

Modified first fit decreasing improves on FFD for items larger than half a bin 
by classifying items by size into four size classes large, medium, small, and tiny, 
corresponding to items with size > 1/2 bin, > 1/3 bin, > 1/6 bin, and smaller items respectively. 
Then it proceeds through five phases:
    
Allot a bin for each large item, ordered largest to smallest.

Proceed forward through the bins. On each: If the smallest remaining medium item does not fit, 
skip this bin. Otherwise, place the largest remaining medium item that fits.

Proceed backward through those bins that do not contain a medium item.
 
On each: If the two smallest remaining small items do not fit, skip this bin.
Otherwise, place the smallest remaining small item and the largest remaining small item that fits.

Proceed forward through all bins. 
If the smallest remaining item of any size class does not fit, 
skip this bin. Otherwise, place the largest item that fits and stay on this bin.
Use FFD to pack the remaining items into new bins.
